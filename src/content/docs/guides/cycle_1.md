## Topics

### Ohm's Law

⚡ Ohm’s Law: Not Just a Formula

In theory, it’s a triangle on a chalkboard.
In practice, it’s the reason your finger got burned.
In spirit, it’s a whisper in every wire: “You can only push so hard.”

Every circuit is a negotiation—between voltage’s desire to move, resistance’s quiet refusal, and current’s flow as the result.

#### Vocabulary
- voltage
- current
- power
- resistance

#### Questions

- *How many amps does it take to make a lightbulb go pop?*
- 

### LED Theory

#### Vocabulary
- Forward voltage
- Wavelength

#### Questions

- How does wavelength relate to kalvin?
- What's the wavelength of infrared?

### Circuit Design

#### Vocabulary
- Project
- Schematic
- PCB
- Symbol
- Footprint
- Track
- Via
- Layer

#### Tooling

- [KiCad]()
 

### Workflow

PCB and circuit design are deeply technical pursuits—but before we write code or simulate electrons, we must learn to move through the digital workshop.

At this stage, it’s less important to code and more important to:
	•	Navigate files and folders confidently.
	•	Use VSCode or another code editor to examine and edit project files.
	•	Share, archive, and version-control designs properly.

#### Vocabulary

- Directory
- Git
- Zip
- Gerber

#### Tooling

- [VSCode]() 

#### Questions

- How would you share a KiCad project to:
  - A collaborator
  - A manufacturer

#### Bonus

Before engaging in PCB design or version control, ensure your system is equipped with essential development tools. This setup will support future workflows and reduce friction when sharing, editing, or versioning projects.
