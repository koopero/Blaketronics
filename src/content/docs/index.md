title: Introduction
---
This is a crash course in practical electronics and digital design, structured to guide you from first principles to the fabrication of your own customized, WiFi-controlled household lighting unit.

The focus is on real-world application. You won’t just be learning theory—you’ll be using it to build something that works. By the end of the program, you’ll have designed and built a functional lighting system: wireless, tailored to your needs, and fabricated from scratch using professional tools.

We’ll move through a series of learning cycles. Each cycle includes:

- Self-guided study of concepts and vocabulary
- A set of focused questions to explore
- A practical assignment or design task
- An in-person session with a quiz, project inspection, and planning for the next cycle

The process is cumulative: each cycle builds on the last, with increasing complexity and capability.

## A Note for You

This guide was written by someone who learns best by poking around, asking weird questions, and doing things the hard way—at least once. You should treat it as a map drawn by a slightly stubborn traveler. It’ll get you where you’re going, but you should still stop and ask for directions now and then.

I’ve used AI a lot while putting this together, and I expect you’ll do the same. Use it to explain things differently, double-check your work, or help you get unstuck. Think of it like a second tutor—one that doesn’t mind being asked the same question five different ways.

If something doesn’t make sense, bring it up. If something seems wrong, challenge it. That’s part of the process. You’re not just learning how electronics work—you’re learning how to think clearly, solve problems, and make stuff that works.

Let’s begin.
